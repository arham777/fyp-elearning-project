- Exporter (who has the latest data):

  ```powershell
  # CWD: backend/lms_backend (venv activated)
  # Generates backend/lms_backend/team_fixture.json (UTF-8)
  python scripts/dump_postgres_utf8.py
  ```

  This uses `django-admin dumpdata` with safe exclusions and writes UTF-8 to avoid Windows encoding issues.

- Share the generated `team_fixture.json` file to teammates (send via chat/Drive; do not commit to git).

- Importer (who wants the data):

  ```powershell
  # Place team_fixture.json into backend/lms_backend
  python -X utf8 manage.py loaddata team_fixture.json
  python scripts/reset_pg_identities.py
  ```
